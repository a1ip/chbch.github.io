# Women's Ministry
Our vision includes providing Encouragement, Sharing, Growth, Friendship, Support, Caring, Serving, Giving, Fun, and Love for women of every age in our church and to those outside our church.

This ministry offers Bible studies, Ladies' Night Outs, Sister-to-Sister prayer events, spa days, and quarterly celebrations of life and blessings.

The team meets at 3:00 p.m. on the first Sunday of the month to plan activities. We welcome new ladies and new ideas!
